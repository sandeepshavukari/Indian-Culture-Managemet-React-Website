      <h1>Indian Culture</h1>
      <p>
        Indian culture is a vibrant tapestry of diverse customs and traditions
        that vary across its vast subcontinent. Rooted in a rich history,
        religion plays a pivotal role, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and
        Sikhism influencing daily life and rituals. Colorful festivals like
        Diwali and Holi are celebrated with great fervor, and Indian cuisine is
        celebrated for its exotic flavors, featuring dishes such as biryani,
        curry, and samosas. Traditional clothing like sarees and dhotis reflects
        the cultural heritage, and the country's artistic and architectural
        achievements, exemplified by the Taj Mahal, are renowned worldwide.
        India's linguistic diversity spans over 20 officially recognized
        languages, and its classical music, dance forms, and Bollywood culture
        continue to captivate global audiences. Family bonds are strong, and
        respect for elders is integral, while the ancient practices of yoga,
        meditation, and spiritual philosophies like karma and dharma underscore
        the profound cultural heritage of India.

        Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has
        been influenced by a history that is several millennia old, beginning
        with the Indus Valley civilization and other early cultural areas. Many
        elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics,
        philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music and movies have had a
        profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India, and the world
        According to Jean Przyluski, there is evidence for regional influence
        from Austroasiatic (Mon Khmer) groups on certain cultural and political
        elements of Ancient India, which may have arrived together with the
        spread of rice cultivation from Mainland Southeast Asia. An ethnic
        minority in Eastern India is still speaking Austroasiatic languages,
        most notably the Munda languages. The British Raj further influenced
        Indian culture, such as through the widespread introduction of the
        English language,and a local dialect developed.

      India has 29 states and 8 union territories with different culture and it is the most populated country in the world. The Indian culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several various cultures, spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced and shaped by a history that is several thousand years old. Throughout the history of India, Indian culture has been heavily influenced by Dharmic religions.Influence from East/Southeast Asian cultures onto ancient India and early Hinduism, specifically Austroasiatic groups, such as early Munda and Mon Khmer, but also Tibetic and other Tibeto-Burmese groups, had noteworthy impact on local Indian peoples and cultures. Several scholars, such as Professor Przyluski, Jules Bloch, and LÃ©vi, among others, concluded that there is a significant cultural, linguistic, and political Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic) influence on early India, which can also be observed by Austroasiatic loanwords within Indo-Aryan languages and rice cultivation, which was introduced by East/Southeast Asian rice-agriculturalists using a route from Southeast Asia through Northeast India into the Indian subcontinent. They have been credited with shaping much of Indian philosophy, literature, architecture, art and music. Greater India was the historical extent of Indian culture beyond the Indian subcontinent. This particularly concerns the spread of Hinduism, Buddhism, architecture, administration and writing system from India to other parts of Asia through the Silk Road by the travelers and maritime traders during the early centuries of the Common Era. To the west, Greater India overlaps with Greater Persia in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains. Over the centuries, there has been a significant fusion of cultures between Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Sikhs and various tribal populations in India.
