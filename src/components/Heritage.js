The state's border regions have been pivotal in India's historical interactions with Tibet, Bhutan, and Southeast Asia. Arunachal Pradesh's rugged terrain has contributed to its isolation, preserving indigenous cultures and traditions among its various tribes, many of which have origins dating back centuries. The ancient pilgrimage site of Parashuram Kund and the medieval fortresses like Bhismaknagar offer glimpses into the state's historical past. The region also played a role in the centuries-old trade routes connecting India with Tibet and other neighboring regions. Arunachal Pradesh's historical heritage, intertwined with its cultural diversity, continues to be a subject of interest and exploration for historians and archaeologists, offering valuable insights into the broader history of the Indian subcontinent."
